# azure-cost-dashboard
Simulated dashboard showing Azure cost savings using optimization levers like VM schedules and right-sizing

# This project showcases a simulated Azure cloud cost dashboard that models real-world infrastructure savings techniques such as:
- VM start/stop automation
- Right-sizing
- Monthly cost analysis

# Built With:
- Power BI
- Public cloud cost data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishi2123/oragnizations-expenses-2023-2024?resource=download
- Simulated optimization scenarios

# Key Features:
- Month-to-month cost and savings tracking
- Visualization by service
- What-if scaling simulation

# Insights:
- Identified top 3 services contributing to high cloud spend

# Files Included:
- `azure_cost_data.csv` – simulated cost dataset
- `azure_dashboard.pbix` – Power BI report
- `summary.pdf` – one-pager overview


This dashboard was inspired by a real challenge faced in large-scale Azure environments: how to measure cost savings when infrastructure cost varies due to scaling.
